# VGDB Frontend: Feature-Driven Client Interface

This repository houses the modern, high-performance web interface for the Video Game Database (VGDB) system. Built using React, Vite, and strict TypeScript, the client operates as an independent web application decoupled from backend execution configurations.

## 🏛️ Client Architectural Design Patterns

### 1. Feature-Driven Architecture (Screaming Architecture)
Folders are structured around clear business modules rather than technical layers. 
* **The Layout:** Structural blocks reside under explicit feature packages: `gameCatalog` and `gameInventory`.
* **The "Why":** This layout directly reflects our backend microservices topology. If the search microservice alters its payload specification, developers modify files inside the isolated `gameCatalog` directory, eliminating cross-contamination or regressions across independent application views.

### 2. Gateway Proxy / API Client Wrapper Pattern
UI components are decoupled from raw network connection configurations via a central network execution abstraction (`gatewayClient.ts`).
* **The "Why":** Components never call raw asynchronous tools natively. They utilize the configured proxy wrapper instance. If the backend API Gateway moves from port `8000` to an alternate cluster domain, or if a global authorization interceptor (JWT injection) is required, modifications remain isolated to **one single file** inside the structural stack.

## 🗂️ File Framework Structure (Strict camelCase / PascalCase Standards)

Utility, file systems, style protocols, and services strictly maintain standard **camelCase** formatting. User Interface components require standard **PascalCase** initialization for correct compilation mapping inside the React framework engine.

🛠️ Local Environment Execution Blueprint
Dependencies Installation
From inside the root layout of the vgdb-frontend directory, trigger local compilation caching packages:

Bash
npm install
Run the Application Dev Server
Instantiate Vite's real-time hot-reloading rendering runtime:

Bash
npm run dev
Navigate to your active local workspace loop: http://localhost:5173.

Verification Test Metrics
Routing Verification: Selecting navigation items inside the Navbar must trigger smooth, immediate component swaps across CatalogPage and InventoryPage paths via React Router Dom, executing zero physical browser page-refresh queries.

Network Proxy Target Validation: Ensure services/gatewayClient.ts targets the centralized API Gateway port specifically: http://localhost:8000/api/v1.
